                <h3>Rentt.io website privacy policy</h3>

                <p>At Rentt.io, we are committed to maintaining the accuracy, confidentiality and security of your personal information. We have developed this website privacy policy to describe our privacy practices and how we collect, use and disclose the personal information of those individuals who visit www.rentt.io (the "Site") or use the information or services that we offer through the Site (the "Services").</p>

                <p>Please take a minute to read this policy so that you understand how we treat your personal information.</p>

                <h3>What is personal information?</h3>

                <p>For the purposes of this privacy policy, personal information is any information about an identifiable individual, other than the person's business title or business contact information when used or disclosed for the purpose of business communications.</p>

                <h3>What personal information do we collect?</h3>

                <p>You may visit the Site and access certain Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself, including your e-mail address. Our web server, however, may collect information related to your visit to the Site or the Services, including the IP address and domain used to access the Site or the Services, the type and version of your browser, the website you came from to access the Site or the Services, the page you entered and exited at, any pages that are viewed by that IP address and what country you are from. We use this information to monitor the Site's and Services' performance (such as number of visits, average time spent per page, number of page views) and for our business purposes such as working to continually upgrade the Site and Services.</p>

                <p>We may collect personal information from you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, and credit card number, when you access some Services, including creating a user account, listing a property online, signing up for e-mail alerts, or contacting us with a question or concern. </p>

                <h3>Why do we collect, use, and disclose personal information?</h3>

                <p>In addition to the specific purposes that we may advise you of at or before the time that we collect your personal information, we may also collect personal information from you so that we may:</p>

                    <li>review and improve the Services that we provide to you;</li>
                    <li>communicate with you and send you information by e-mail, postal mail, telephone, text message, or other means about our Services, unless you have directed us not to contact you with promotional communications;</li>

A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your hard drive through your web browser that can only be read by the website that placed the cookie on your hard drive. The cookie acts as an identification card and allows the Site to identify you and to record your passwords and preferences. The cookie allows us to track your visit to the Site or Services so that we can better understand your use of the Site and Services so that we can customize and tailor it to better meet your needs.

                <h3>Application and interpretation of this privacy policy</h3>

                <p>It is our policy to comply with the privacy legislation within each jurisdiction in which we operate.

                <p>This privacy policy does not create or confer upon any individual any rights, or impose upon Rentt any rights or obligations outside of, or in addition to, any rights or obligations imposed by applicable laws. Should there be, in a specific case, any inconsistency between this privacy policy and such laws, this privacy policy shall be interpreted, in respect of that case, to give effect to, and comply with, such laws.</p>

                <h3>Modifications to this privacy policy</h3>

                <p>From time to time, we may make changes to this privacy policy to reflect changes in our legal or regulatory obligations or in the manner in which we deal with your personal information.
